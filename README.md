# Antioch
Minecraft 1.10.2 Spigot plugin (spigot-1.10.2-R0.1-b986-TE-patched.jar)

First one I ever made on Minecraft.
Type "/antioch" to get the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, and right click to throw it.
Explosion set to 50 blocks radius by default, bcs is fun.
Doesn't mess up with WorldGuard if u disable explosions damages.

Plugin designed by raidmax21 for training purpose on TeamExtremeMC server.
